# Filà Magenta - Web
The web application for the Filà Magenta.

## Wireless Capabilities
Some functions of the web require bluetooth capabilities. Only some browsers support it.

You can take a look at the [Compatibility table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Bluetooth#browser_compatibility) to see if your browser is compatible.

On Chrome-based browsers you might need to enable the [`#enable-experimental-web-platform-features`](chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features) flag.
